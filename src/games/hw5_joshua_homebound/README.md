## Controls
| Input                            | Action                   |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `w`                              | Fly up                   |
| `a`                              | Fly left                 |
| `s`                              | Fly down                 |
| `d`                              | Fly right                |
| [`w` \| `a` \| `s` \| `d`] + `p` | Boost speed in direction |

Common engine controls can be found in the engine [README](../../../README.md#common-inputs)

> Speed boosts require a key chord, meaning both keys must be pressed simultaneously. For example, to boost upward, press `w + p` together. Pressing `w` after `p` or vice versa will result in flying up or pausing the game.
