| Input                            | Action                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `w`                              | Hop up                  |
| `a`                              | Hop left                |
| `s`                              | Hop down                |
| `d`                              | Hop right               |
| [`w` \| `a` \| `s` \| `d`] + `p` | Double hop in direction |

Common engine controls can be found in the engine [README](../../../README.md#common-inputs)

> Double hops require a key chord, meaning both keys must be pressed simultaneously. For example, to double hop upward, press `w + p` together. Pressing `w` after `p` or vice versa will result in a single hop or pausing the game.
